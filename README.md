# The Cloud Foundry Application Promoter 

This application takes an application instance and remaps the URL bound to it. It would be trivial to then go a step further and switch between one URL and another to support blue-green deployments [as described here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html).
